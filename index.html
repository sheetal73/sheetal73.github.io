I am a multilingual with fluency in English,Hindi,Nepali,Korean and Chinese(level 2). If I am to describe myself in a sentence then I would say <b>"Just Tryna Finess my way through life"</b> I try to stay optimistic and strong when hurdles comes my way. As a perfectionist when it come to getting things done  sometimes its is difficult for me to keep my calm but I count that as my strength as it keeps me wanting to learn more, and end what I started by giving it my best. <b>Yeah you can expect a product that won't be disappointing!</b> <br> Adaptive would be my another strength, with having to change school every two year and with coming to a whole different state to persue my degree, I for sure can say that it woouldn't be difficult for me to adapt and work in any the given circumstances!</p>
